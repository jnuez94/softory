"""Per-role permissions for unattended runs.

Claude Code gets a settings file per role: edits only in the role's own
paths (its lane, or its docs folder), the coordination and git commands every
role needs, the owner's extra commands, and nothing else. In ``-p`` mode a
tool that isn't allowed is refused, so a role can't wander. Codex has no path
rules; it runs in its workspace-write sandbox, and the gate's ``lane_paths``
check catches a diff outside the lane for either harness.
